=======

`Shapely <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html>`__ is
great for working with geometries, but if you're dealing with Geographic
Information Systems
(`GIS <https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/>`__)
there are times when you really need your geometries to have some
awareness of `spatial
reference <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system>`__.
This project seeks to combine ``Shapely`` with
`pyproj <https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/>`__ and some other
conveniences to make working with geometries across spatial references
easy and fun!

Project Features
----------------

-  `shapeit <https://readthedocs.org/projects/shapeit/>`__
-  automated unit tests you can run with
   `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__
-  a `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ documentation
   project

Getting Started
---------------

The project's documentation contains a section to help you `get
started <https://shapeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`__
as a developer or user of the library.

Examples
--------

WGS84 to UTM
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example we'll start with a latitude and a longitude and create a
point that happens to be in `UTM zone
15N <https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/32615/>`__ (32615). We'll
then use the ``as_utm`` method to create the equivalent point in the UTM
coordinate system.

.. code:: python

    from shapeit import SrPoint

    # Create a point from a latitude, longitude.
    wgs84 = SrPoint.from_lat_lon(lat=45.553670, lon=-94.142430)

    # Convert it to UTM.
    utm = wgs84.as_utm()

    # What are the coordinates of the UTM point?
    print(f'x={utm.x}, y={utm.y}')

    # What's the SRID of the UTM point's coordinate system.
    print(f"The UTM SRID is: {utm.srid}")

.. code:: sh

    x=410830.5412685075, y=5045093.805781859
    The UTM SRID is: 32615

Development Prerequisites
-------------------------

If you're going to be working in the code (rather than just using the
library), you'll want a few utilities.

-  `GNU Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`__
-  `Pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`__

Resources
---------

Below are some handy resource links.

-  `Project Documentation <http://shapeit.readthedocs.io/>`__
-  `Click <http://click.pocoo.org/5/>`__ is a Python package for
   creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with
   as little code as necessary.
-  `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ is a tool that
   makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation,
   written by Geog Brandl and licnsed under the BSD license.
-  `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__ helps you write
   better programs.
-  [GNU Make] is a tool which controls the generation of executables and
   other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.
