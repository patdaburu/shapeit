=======

`Shapely <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html>`_ is great for
working with geometries, but if you're dealing with Geographic Information
Systems (`GIS <https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/>`_)
there are times when you really need your geometries to have some awareness of
`spatial reference <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system>`_.
This project seeks to combine `Shapely` with
`pyproj <https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/>`_ and some other conveniences to make
working with geometries across spatial references easy and fun!
